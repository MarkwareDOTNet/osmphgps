# overlays in MapSource don't seem to work with bitmap TYP elements, only solid lines, but work fine in the GPS itself
# also, overlays in MapSource are plotted in the reverse order to on the GPS (e.g. oneway arrows plot under lines in MapSource, but on top of lines in GPS

#motorway:
0x123: 0x02, 0x10
0x124: 0x03, 0x10
